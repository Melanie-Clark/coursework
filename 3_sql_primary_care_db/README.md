# Assignment Three

## 2. Stored procedure - New patient registration:
A new patient registers at a GP practice. 
- The patient is added to the patients table. If the address doesn't exist in the `addresses` table, it's then also added.
- The earliest available appointment is automatically booked with the Nurse.\
If no appointments are available, a message is displayed.
 
## 3. Delete, update and retrieval queries:
- A member of staff _(Miss Willing N-Able)_ has been fired for not being very willing or able - Staff member is **deleted** from `staff_members` table.
